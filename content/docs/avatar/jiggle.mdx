## To add Jiggle Physics

For each jiggle root:
- Add a new component `Jiggle Rig`, which can be placed in a separate gameObject, but it must under the hierarchy of your Avatar root.
- In the Jiggle Rig component, ensure to set a `Root Transform`, which is a bone in the avatar armature.
- If you have a parent bone (for multiple chains of child bones that you wish to apply the same effect to) you can enable `Motionless Root` to only affect the child bones and not the root itself. (Optional)
- Adjust `Settings` to your liking (activate `Advanced` to view all settings).

## Collision Interaction

- Activate `Advanced` to view all settings.
- Enable `Collision` and adjust `Collision Radius` to fit the object.

## Interactions with Animation Rigging

Currently with Jiggle Bones, any GameObjects/Bones affected by a Jiggle Bone Component and are referenced by a Animation Rigging Constraint need a `Rig Transform` Component added to them.
<Callout type="info">
Adding `Rig Transform` components do have a cost associated to them so don't add it to all GameObjects on your avatar or prop.
