Documentation can be found for all the Constraints that Animation Rigging provides [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.animation.rigging@1.4/manual/ConstraintComponents.html)

## Setup for Animation Rigging Packages
<Steps>

<Step>
**Adding Rig Builder**: Add a `Rig Builder` component and `Animator` component on the `Armature` GameObject.

<Callout type="info">
*Basis uses the Root/Avatar's GameObject animator for animation and rigging*. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**You can not use the Avatar's animator for the Rig Builder. Doing so will break animations and Basis armature initialization.**
</Callout>
</Step>
<Step>
**Creating Rig Setup**: Create an empty GameObject named "Rig Setup" and add the `Rig` component to it.

</Step>

<Step>
**Assigning Rig Setup**: Assign the "Rig Setup" GameObject to the `Rig Builder` component of the `Armature`.

## Notes on Jiggle Bones

If Jiggle Bones is affecting any constraints you have to add the `Rig Transform` to all parent bones of the constraint bone.

<abbr title="For example">E.g.</abbr> You have a laser that is constrained to look the direction of your avatar's head. You have to go from parent of the laser adding `Rig Transform` components until you hit an Armature/Humanoid bone.
<Callout type="info">
This includes all source bones if they are not part of the humanoid. <abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr> Wings that are affected by Jiggle Bones need `Rig Transform` components if you have a constraint reference them.
</Callout>

## Rotation Constraints
<Steps>

<Step>

Do the [Setup](#setup-for-animation-rigging-packages) first than continue with instructions for setting up Rotation Constraints.

</Step>

<Step>

Add the `Multi-Rotation Constraint` Component onto an GameObject that is a child of the `Rig Setup` GameObject.

</Step>

<Step>

Assign the bone you want affected in the Constrained Object field. One or more source objects can be used.
<Callout type="info">
You can drag and drop the source bones/GameObjects onto the Source Objects in the area highlighted in Red.
You can only add one `Multi-Rotation Constraint` per gameObject.
