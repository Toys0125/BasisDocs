title: Building from Linux
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout type="warn">
Linux support is experimental and may have extra issues.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
It is not recommended to build a Windows or Android build from Linux currently as they will likely be missing features or not function at all.
</Callout>

This page assumes you have gone through [Getting Started](/docs) first.

## Linux prerequisites

<Callout type="error">
**Do not commit the removal of the Utilities listed on this doc page!**
They are required for building Windows and Android clients!
</Callout>

In order to build anything Basis under Linux you need to remove `com.meta.xr.sdk.core` "Meta XR Core SDK" and `com.unity.xr.openxr` "OpenXR Plugin" via the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui.html).

You may need to install `com.unity.toolchain.linux-x86_64` "Toolchain Linux x64" but Unity should install that for you.

## Building .BEE files from Linux

For building .bee files for Windows and Android from a Linux Editor you will need to delete the `Assets/Basis/Profiles/HTCViveTrackerProfile.cs` file and set the "Scripting Backend" to `Mono` under `Edit > Project Settings > Player > Configuration > Scripting Backend`.

## Building a native Linux client from Linux

<Callout type="info">
It is recommended to change your "Scripting Backend" to `IL2CPP` for better performance.

</Callout>

- Make sure you have [removed the unsupported packages](#linux-prerequisites) first.
- Make sure you *do not* have `Use Scene Provided Here` checked from [World Testing](/docs/world#test-the-scene).
- Make sure the `Packages/com.basis.sdk/Scenes/Initialization` Scene is open.

Then build Basis as you would normally.

## Basis VR on Linux

You may need to launch Basis with the `--force-OpenVRLoader` flag for it to function properly in VR:

```bash
./basis.x86_64 --force-OpenVRLoader
```

You do not use this when launching for Desktop.

## Proton / Wine

If you wish to use OpenXR with a Windows build under Proton / Wine you can add:

```bash
PRESSURE_VESSEL_IMPORT_OPENXR_1_RUNTIMES=1 %command% --disable-OpenVRLoader --force-OpenVRLoader
```

To your Steam Launch Arguments.
