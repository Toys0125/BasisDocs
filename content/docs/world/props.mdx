## What Are Props?

Props are interactive objects which can be loaded into a Basis scene and optionally synchronised across a network.

## How to Create a Prop

- Select a Gameobject and add a Basis Prop component to it.
- Enter an Asset Bundle Name.
- Optionally, add an Asset Bundle Description.
- Press the 'Create Prop Bee File' button and wait for this process to complete.

- The results will be opened in a new window automatically as shown below.

## How to Create a Network Synced Prop

Props can be network synced and generated at runtime. Below is example of how to load a network synced Pickup Interactable cube:

- Add a cube object in the scene hierarchy.

![Inspector Window at Cube](/img/props/2A.png)

- Add a Basis Pickup Interactable component. This allows a local player to pick up and move the cube.

- Add a Basis Object Sync Networking component. This allows the cube to be synced for all players.

![Inspector Window at Basic Object Sync Networking component](/img/props/2C.png)

- Add a Basis Prop component, enter an Asset Bundle Name and press the 'Create Prop Bee File' button. The generated .bee files will be used by the Basis Runtime Loader to load the network synced cube into a scene.

### Spawning the Prop into a Scene Using the Runtime Loader

- Create an empty Gameobject and give it a suitable name.

- Attach the Runtime Loader component to it.

- Enter your generated prop password and .bee url.

- Select Persistent to ensure synced changes persist for late-joining players.

- In the Unity Editor toolbar, select Basis and click on the Loadable Config Editor. This Basis config editor is used to genertate XML files which Basis can use to spawn props into a scene.

![Unity toolbar showing Basis Loadable Config Editor setting](/img/props/4A.png)

- Enter 0 for the mode value. The 0 simply means that this is a loadable prop (a mode value of 1 is used for scenes).

- Enter the same generated password and .bee url used previously.

- Select Persist to ensure synced changes persist for late-joining players.

- Click 'Save XML' and enter an appropriate file name to generate an XML file for the network synced pickup cube 

![Inspector window of Basis Config](/img/props/4B.png)

- The generated XML will be located in: *Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0\initialresources*

![Location of generated XML output](/img/props/4C.png)

- Its output should look something like this:

```xml title="PropDemo.xml"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
<BasisLoadableConfiguration>
  <!-- Mode of the configuration --><Mode>0</Mode>
  <!-- Network ID --><LoadedNetID></LoadedNetID>
  <!-- Unlock password --><UnlockPassword><GENERATED-BEE-PASSWORD></UnlockPassword>
  <!-- Combined URL --><CombinedURL><GENERATED-BEE-URL></CombinedURL>
  <!-- Local load flag --><IsLocalLoad>false</IsLocalLoad>

  <!-- Position values --><PositionX>0</PositionX><PositionY>0</PositionY><PositionZ>0</PositionZ>

  <!-- Quaternion values --><QuaternionX>0</QuaternionX><QuaternionY>0</QuaternionY><QuaternionZ>0</QuaternionZ><QuaternionW>0</QuaternionW>

  <!-- Scale values --><ScaleX>1</ScaleX><ScaleY>1</ScaleY><ScaleZ>1</ScaleZ>

  <!-- Persist flag --><Persist>true</Persist>
</BasisLoadableConfiguration>
``` 

### Checking the Server to Confirm the Prop Loads

- You can check if your prop is loaded correctly by the server. To do so, run the *BasisNetworkConsole.exe*, which is located at *Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0*.

<Callout type="info">
You will need to register yourself as an admin for the prop to be able to load. You can do this by entering entering the command */admin add* did:key:\<YOUR-KEY\> or by editing *Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0\config\admins.xml*.

You can find your key by opening up the Basis application and selecting your player's UUID in the Admin settings.

### Setting up the Basis Scene and Testing the Pickup Cube

- Before you can test out the network synced pickup cube, ensure that your scene has a Basis Scene component attached to an empty Gameobject.

- Click 'Create Scene Bee File'.

- Open up the Load Config editor again.

- Enter your generated scene password and .bee url.

- Ensure Persistent is selected so that synced changes persist for late-joining players.

- Click Save XML.

![Inspector Window for load config](/img/props/5B.png)

- Open up the 'Initialization' scene and press play. This initialises the created scene and network objects. The next time when you load the scene through the server while running the basis application, all players will be able to interact with the network synced cube.

## How to Spawn a Prop Using a Scene button

The Runtime Loader component will generate any props located in *Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0\initialresources* at runtime. It is also possible to use a button with a scene to generate props. To do so:

- Add a canvas object to your scene. Make sure to attach the relevant components similar to what was shown in the previous sections. Remember to add a Basis Prop component to generate a .bee file for your prop and upload it to a remote server. 

![Inspector Window showing canvas and components](/img/props/6A.png)

- Create a TMP button.

![Inspector Window showing button and components](/img/props/6B.png)

- Add a Basis Prop component, enter an Asset Bundle Name and press the 'Create Prop Bee File' button. The generated .bee files will be used by the Basis Runtime Loader to load the prop into a scene. For this example, we will use the network synced cube from the previous section again.

![Inspector Window showing synced cube and components](/img/props/6B-.png)

- Create an empty Gameobject and attach a Runtime Loader component to it. This will be used to spawn the prop. To avoid props being generated on scene start up, disable the component in the inspector.

![Inspector Window showing Runtime Loader which is disabled](/img/props/6C.png)

<Callout type="info">
If you want your prop to be network synced, add a networking syncing component to it. For instance, you can use the Basis Object Network Syncing component, as shown previously, to synchronise prop movement. 

You can also create your own network syncing code. For inspiration and to help you get started, you can refer to example packages *Basis Ported Pooltable* and *Basis Vehicles* which you can find inside the project.
</Callout>

- Select your button and add an onClick() event to it. Assign your Runtime Loader Gameobject, making sure to select BasisRuntimeLoader.LoadNow as the method which your button will call on when clicked.

![Inspector Window showing button event calling RuntimeLoader](/img/props/6D.png)

- Open up the Load Config editor.

- Enter your generated prop password and .bee url.

- Ensure Persistent is selected so that synced changes persist for late-joining players.

- Click Save XML.

![Inspector Window showing load config](/img/props/6E.png)

- If you haven't already, create an empty Gamebject and attach a Basis Scene component to it, filling in the relevant fields. Once set, click 'Create Scene Bee File'.

![Inspector Window showing Basis scene](/img/props/6F.png)

- Open up the Load Config editor again.

- Enter your generated scene password and .bee url.

- Ensure Persistent is selected so that synced changes persist for late-joining players.

- Click Save XML.

![Inspector Window showing button and components](/img/props/6G.png)

- Open up the 'Initialization' scene and press play. This initialises the created scene and network objects. The next time when you load the scene through the server while running the basis application, you should be able to spawn your prop via a button.
