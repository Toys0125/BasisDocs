## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is BasisVR?

BasisVR is a software framework, that empowers developers with deep technology integrations and best-in-class approaches, for creating social experiences in Virtual Reality.

<Callout type="info">
Note: ***Basis is not a Social VR platform***. It includes useful primitives, but the core project is not intended to create the sort of scalable social infrastructure that Social VR platforms require. It does not specifically obstruct creators who wish to create their own, but the project itself ships frameworks and demos.
